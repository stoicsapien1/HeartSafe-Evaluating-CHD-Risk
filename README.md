## OBJECTIVE

The main task of predicting whether a patient has a 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) means that you are trying to determine the likelihood that a patient will develop CHD within the next 10 years based on certain factors.ðŸ©ºðŸ«€


Specifically, you want to build a predictive model using data about patients' demographics, behaviors, and medical history to classify them into one of two categories:

**High Risk (1)**: The patient is predicted to have a high likelihood of developing CHD within the next 10 years.

**Low Risk (0)**: The patient is predicted to have a low likelihood of developing CHD within the next 10 years.
